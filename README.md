# HowToDIV Dataset: Dialogues, Instructions and Videos for Task Assistance

This repo contains the code and data for constructing HowToDIV dataset and the benchmark from the paper [``Generating Dialogues from Egocentric Instructional Videos for Task Assistance: Dataset, Method and Benchmark``](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11192).
 
## Overview
Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car maintenance require expert knowledge,  especially when tasks are complex and multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a dearth of dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person instructional videos into task-guidance two-person dialogues, aligned with fine grained steps and video-clips. Our fully automatic approach, powered by large language models, offers an efficient alternative to the substantial cost and effort required for manual data collection. Using this technique, we build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636 question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for procedural-task assistance.


## Getting Started
Please download original EgoPER Dataset from ([https://github.com/robert80203/EgoPER_official](https://github.com/robert80203/EgoPER_official)) and NIV Dataset from ([https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/instructionvideos/](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/instructionvideos/))

HowToDIV dataset consists of 507 conversations covering 6636 novice - expert dialogue turns ranging over 9 tasks: Mechanics - Jump start a car, Change car tire, Cooking - Prepare coffee using a moka pot, Cook a tortilla, Prepare pinwheels, Make tea, Prepare filter coffee, Make Quesadilla, and Planting - Repot a plant. For each session, the dataset provides multi-turn user-expert dialogues, task instructions and per-turn video annotations. Our video annotations consist of start and stop times; these timestamps correspond to videos in the given original datasets.
